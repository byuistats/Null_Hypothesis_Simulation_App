# Null_Hypothesis_Simulation_App

This app simulates the sample-to-sample variability for group differences under the null hypothesis. It allows users to visualize how sample means can vary due to random sampling, even when the null hypothesis is true. 

# Features
- Simulates group samples from a normal distribution with a specified population mean and standard deviation.
- Allows users to specify the sample size for each group. 
- Visualizes the distribution of sample means and highlights the population mean.

# How to Use
